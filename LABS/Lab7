# Solution Overview for Finding the City with the Smallest Number of Reachable Cities

## Problem Statement
Given a number of cities connected by weighted edges, determine which city has the fewest number of other cities that can be reached within a given distance threshold.

## Approach
The solution involves the following steps:

### 1. Initialization
- **Distance Matrix:** Initialize a distance matrix `dist` where `dist[i][j]` represents the shortest distance from city `i` to city `j`. 
Initially, set all values to a large number (to represent infinity) except the diagonal (self-distances), which are set to zero.

### 2. Input Edges
- **Set Edge Distances:** For each provided edge connecting cities `u` and `v` with a weight `w`, set `dist[u][v]` and `dist[v][u]` to `w`.

### 3. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- **All-Pairs Shortest Path:** Apply the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of cities. 
This involves updating the distance matrix to ensure that each `dist[i][j]` contains the shortest possible distance between cities `i` and `j`.

### 4. Determine Reachable Cities
- **Count Reachable Cities:** For each city `i`, count how many other cities `j` can be reached such that `dist[i][j]` is less than or equal to the distance threshold.

### 5. Select City with Minimum Reachable Cities
- **Find Minimum:** Identify the city with the smallest number of reachable cities. If multiple cities have the same number of reachable cities, the city with the smallest index is chosen.

## Conclusion
This solution efficiently determines which city is the most isolated in terms of reachable neighbors within a given distance threshold using dynamic programming and graph theory concepts, specifically through the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for shortest
